# Earhquake-Damage-Data-analysis

All the natural disasters including earthquakes are unforeseeable events that cause a huge loss to infrastructure, economy as well as to
living beings. Earthquakes have always been a serious threat for ensuring a progressive rational future. Even the developed countries like
Japan, ten years ago in March 2011, experienced a tragic earthquake in Fukushima that brought about more than 18,000 human loss and
wiped out the Fukushima from worldâ€™s map. So our main objective through this practical report is that to analyze those factors that caused
that much damage.We have done this project by using the Python and its assoiciated libraries. Moreover, through visulaization we have
showed different analysis. Like how much building structure,land surface,foundation type effect the damage grade.
